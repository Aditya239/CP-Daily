## Collaborator checklist
* When posing a problem/challenge for the day provide links to problem, online judge/site etc and title, and append :hourglass_flowing_sand:. Try and populate for the problems for the upcoming week in advance. This can very well be a 7 problems a week repository but that is the limit of flexibility - the idea is not to have too much backlog at any time.
* Each day's deliverable is a subdirectory titled titled by the day index (say `Day1`) and further subdirectories named after collaborators, currently `Blastoise` and `Aditya239` within which their respective codes should rest. After the accepted solution is pushed and task is completed, replace one's :hourglass_flowing_sand: with :white_check_mark:
